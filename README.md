# Decision Optimization in Cricket Gameplay

In the dynamic world of cricket, making the right decisions on each ball can be the difference between victory and defeat. This project was dedicated to enhancing decision-making in cricket gameplay scenarios by leveraging principles from Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Hereâ€™s a summary of our key accomplishments:

1. Contextualizing Cricket Gameplay: The project aimed to provide an optimal action in various in-game situations. To achieve this, the focus was on modeling the game setting as an MDP.
2. MDP Conversion: The project transforms the intricate dynamics of a cricket game into a formal Markov Decision Process. This conversion process allows to mathematically represent the transitions between game states, enabling more structured decision-making.
3. Algorithm Implementation: One of the core contributions of the project was the implementation of various MDP solution algorithms, including Value Iteration and HPI (Howard's Policy Iteration), from scratch. These algorithms played a pivotal role in determining the optimal actions in different cricket gameplay scenarios.
4. Decision Optimization: The work ultimately led to the optimization of decision-making in cricket. By applying MDP techniques and the custom-built algorithms, the algorithm recommended optimal actions based on the given probabilities of different outcomes for specific actions in the game.
